\#\#read in data and fix species names

\#\#distribution \#\#currently this is ~ FAO areas table (minus “note”
field) e.g. <http://www.fishbase.us/Country/FaoAreaList.php?ID=5537>
\#\#each species may have multiple bounding boxes

Read in the FAO areas (from
<http://www.fao.org/geonetwork/srv/en/main.home?uuid=ac02a460-da52-11dc-9d70-0017f293bd28>
as described by
<http://www.fishbase.us/manual/English/FishbaseThe_FAOAREAS_Table.htm>).
It looks like our data contain both the inland and marine FAOs, so I
read in both and combined them according to a single column of FAO code.

\#\#check out some tables in fishbase \#\#brains: one entry for each
individual fish: BrainWeight, BodyWeight
\#\#<https://www.fishbase.in/manual/fishbasethe_brains_table.htm>

\#\#country: multiple rows per species; for
example:

## countrysub – multiple rows per species

\#\#estimate: a table of estimates from some models on trophic levels
\#\#<http://www.fishbase.us/manual/English/FishbaseThe_FOOD_ITEMS_table.htm>

\#\#faoareas, seems to be redundant to countrysub?

\#\#fecundity \#\#sometimes multiple rows per species. could not
\#\#could not locate doc table about fecundity. spawning table seems to
be something different (different fields):

\#\#fooditems – including this one
\#\#<http://www.fishbase.org/manual/english/fishbasethe_food_items_table.htm>
\#\#multiple rows per species, for different food types, life stages of
predator, locality, etc.

\#\#genetic – don’t think we want to use this, but including just to see
what it shows

\#\#introductions – species introductions data. for now making one new
feature: the number of records about introductions; it seems that each
row is a different place
\#\#<https://www.fishbase.in/manual/fishbasethe_introduction_table.htm>

\#\#length\_weight: The LENGTH-WEIGHT table presents the a and b values
of over 5,000 length-weight relationships of the form W = a x Lb,

some species. \#\#seems like this may only be useful in combination with
length\_length
\#\#<https://www.fishbase.de/manual/FishbaseThe_LENGTH_WEIGHT_Table.htm>

\#\#maturity \#\#multiple records for some species, would need to take

choose from.

\#\#there are multiple records for some species (e.g. for different
sexes); to include we would need to take averages \#\#include along with
potentially influencing variables – e.g. salinity, temp, swimming speed,
