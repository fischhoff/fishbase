It is therefore important to know all the countries where a species occurs, and vice-versa. As mentioned above, the distributional range of many species is not well established. Country-specific checklists of fishes prepared by non-taxonomists often contain misidentifications and generally cannot be verified; on the other hand, complete checklists published by taxonomists and based on verifiable specimen collections do not exist for many countries.

In FishBase, data in the DIET table are also used to estimate the trophic level of species

The categorical breakdown of possible habitats summarizes the otherwise lengthy text descriptions for species found in different types of environment, and makes such descriptive data accessible to rigorous queries.

A choice field classifies such occurrence into: native; endemic (i.e., naturally occurring in no other FAO area); introduced; extirpated (i.e., extinct in this area but still existing in other FAO areas); reintroduced (i.e., after extirpation); unclear. Note that strains and artificial hybrids are always classified as introduced, even if the strain originates from the FAO area in question, because hybrids and strains are by definition genetically distinct from wild populations.

These include the length of the Coastline, the estimated Shelf area to 200 m depth, and the area of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) [not presently shown in user version]. Note, however, that coastline length has a fractal dimension and thus should not be used in comparative studies unless measured with the same 'stick length'. WRI is working on such standardized coastline lengths, and we will use these as soon as they become available.

It is mainly the meristic characters that are used for quick identification, following the database identification scheme of Froese and Papasissi (1990). The structure of the MORPHOLOGY table and the choice of fields it includes are based on a close study of major texts in ichthyology (e.g., Lagler et al. 1977) and consultation with numerous colleagues. Some of the terms employed in the table are highly specialized; their definition may be found in the FishBase Glossary.

The data can also be used to generate empirical relationships between growth parameters or natural mortality estimates, and their correlates (e.g., body shape, temperature, etc.), a line of research that is useful both for stock assessment and for increasing understanding of the evolution of life-history strategies
    ## 24 Length-frequency data are widely used to derive growth estimates, especially in small tropical fishes (see the POPGROWTH table, this vol.). Froese and Binohlan (2000) have shown that length-frequency curves can also be used to get a first assessment of the status of a stock  if the data are plotted in a framework of asymptotic length, length at optimum yield, and length at first maturity (see Key Facts, this vol.). With this new table, we try to collect and preserve historical data from unfished or still lightly fished populations, to be contrasted with the curves typically produced from overexploited stocks, where the large, highly fecund fish (the Mega-spawners) have disappeared and the bulk of the catch is made up of juveniles which had no chance to reproduce.

The LENGTH-WEIGHT table presents the a and b values of over 5,000 length-weight relationships of the form W = a x Lb, pertaining to about over 2,000 fish species.  The units of length and weight in FishBase are centimeter and gram, respectively.

Every bit of information in FishBase is attached directly or indirectly to at least one species and it is mostly through this table that information is accessed. The SPECIES table covers all of the estimated 25,000 extant fishes.

Similarly, aquaculturists work with 'strains', i.e., races or varieties of a certain species. Again, the distinction between a population or 'race' and a subspecies is unclear.

While these assumptions were largely true, we dreadfully underestimated the remaining difficulties such as inconsistencies in recent publications, the necessity to keep track of and completely understand taxonomic works, and the sometimes detective-like work needed to assign a piece of information to the proper biological species.

    ## 1 At hatching, no eye pigmentation and no fin buds are present. Eye pigmentation start to appear 36 hours after hatching and completed at 54 hours. The mouth opened at 54 hours and soon became movable (mouth width was 500 <b5>m). Long and straight gut reaches to about 80% of BL.\r\nPigmentation: Black pigment cells are present in the finfold except the tip of the caudal region. Pigment is also scattered in the yolk mass and on the head and body of the larva (Ref. 139).\r\nThe arrangement of muscle fibers in the myotomes of <i>Chanos</i> larvae is parallel to the longitudinal axis of the body. Characteristic swimming behaviour: the larvae  remains suspended head down in the water column near the surface, then sinks slowly, upon reaching a depth of about 5-8 cm, the larvae makes a sudden upward turn of 360<b0> before swimming rapidly to the surface. This behaviour lasts mainly for two days. At this stage, larvae are slightly negatively bouyant (Ref. 43081).

    ## 1 Yolk is completely absorbed on the 3rd day.\r\nEyes well pigmented. Functional mouth with an opening present. At flexion, body becomes transparent and stomach contents visible. Larvae (and adults) lack teeth. \r\nPigmentation: Pigments scattered over the upper half of the body and on peritoneal wall. Mediolateral pigment on the caudal region proceeding anteriorly. Pigmentation on head region increases.\r\nSequence of fin development: pectoral, caudal, dorsal and anal, pelvic.

Monogamous mating is observed as both obligate and genetic (Ref. 52884). Eggs are demersal and adhere to the substrate (Ref. 205).  Males guard and aerate the eggs (Ref. 205). Does not have a juvenile bisexual phase and all males have the typical testicular morphology of gonochores (Ref. 103751).
    ## 2 Distinct pairing with embrace. Oviparous, laying 10-45 egg cases each year (Ref. 44869, 41305). Eggs are oblong capsules with stiff pointed horns at the corners deposited in sandy or muddy flats (Ref. 205). Egg capsules are 3.4-8.9 cm long and 2.3-6.8 cm wide (Ref. 41250). Paired eggs are laid. Embryos feed solely on yolk (Ref. 50449). In the North Sea, fully formed individuals hatch after 4 months and pups are about 8-11 cm in length (Ref. 44869, 37969). In the Barents Sea, low water temperature may lengthen embryonic development time to 2.5-3 years (Ref. 44869). \r\n

Monogamous mating is observed as both obligate and genetic (Ref. 52884). Eggs are demersal and adhere to the substrate (Ref. 205).  Males guard and aerate the eggs (Ref. 205). Does not have a juvenile bisexual phase and all males have the typical testicular morphology of gonochores (Ref. 103751).
    ## 2 Distinct pairing with embrace. Oviparous, laying 10-45 egg cases each year (Ref. 44869, 41305). Eggs are oblong capsules with stiff pointed horns at the corners deposited in sandy or muddy flats (Ref. 205). Egg capsules are 3.4-8.9 cm long and 2.3-6.8 cm wide (Ref. 41250). Paired eggs are laid. Embryos feed solely on yolk (Ref. 50449). In the North Sea, fully formed individuals hatch after 4 months and pups are about 8-11 cm in length (Ref. 44869, 37969). In the Barents Sea, low water temperature may lengthen embryonic development time to 2.5-3 years (Ref. 44869). \r\n
